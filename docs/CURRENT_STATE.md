## Last sessions (2026-05-06 → 2026-05-07)

### 2026-05-07 PM — homepage trim + static stats + seasonal ribbon
1. **Homepage trimmed from 11 → 7 sections.** Removed `DepartmentCategories`, `AudiencePathways`, `PromisesSection` from `/`. The verb nav + EmergencyModule already cover this work; the three sections were three competing IA models stacked on the same page.
2. **QuickServices tightened from 9 → 6 cards** (3-col grid). Animal shelter, emergency services, veterans benefits dropped — reachable via verb nav and search; emergency services is duplicated by EmergencyModule above.
3. **NextMeetingCard** slimmed from a two-column hero card to a single navy banner row.
4. **Hero stat-counter removed.** `useCountUp` was rendering "0+ Residents 0 Square Miles 0 Departments" in SSR until JS hydrated and IntersectionObserver fired — real correctness bug for slow JS / reduced motion / screen readers. Stats now render final values directly.
5. **Suggested-search chips** under the hero search input (`pay taxes · marriage license · trash pickup · pothole · voter registration`). Each chip dispatches `sullivan:open-search` with `detail.query`; `SearchDialog` accepts `initialQuery` and pre-fills.
6. **Open-Now / Next-Meeting promoted** to a single readable sentence above the identity stats — was 5 small 9-pt-uppercase tiles competing for attention.
7. **`SeasonalRibbon` component** — date-aware (Oct 1 – Mar 1) banner below hero linking to `/property-taxes` with the Feb 28 deadline. Out of season (May), correctly hidden. Unit-tested across 8 month boundaries.

### 2026-05-07 AM — verb nav + parcel lookup + e2e green
1. **Verb-based primary nav** — replaced heritage-led top nav (History/Communities/Commissioners/News/Calendar/Documents/Contact) with **Pay · Apply · Report · Records · Meetings · Departments · About**. Each verb opens a mega-panel of concrete tasks (GOV.UK / Cook County "I Want To" pattern). Heritage routes consolidated under About. Departments mega-menu preserved as one verb. Definitions in `src/data/nav-verbs.ts`.
2. **Parcel lookup on `/property-taxes`** — single-box typeahead routes citizens to the right official portal. Server fn proxies the TN Comptroller's TPAD autocomplete (no HTML scraping). Three side-by-side CTAs: View assessment (TPAD) · Pay your taxes (Trustee) · View on map (ArcGIS Online web map). GIS link upgraded from generic `gis.sullivancountytn.gov/` to the actual web map.
3. **A11y hardening** — kbd contrast (search shortcut hint), `bg-white/95` → `bg-white` on hero search button, Pay Taxes CTA always copper-on-white (was failing 1.05:1 on `/history`), CommunityMap SVG dropped `role="img"` so the focusable anchors inside aren't double-wrapped.
4. **Per-IP rate limiting** — composite `key:ip` keys via `getRequestIP()` + `cf-connecting-ip`. Previously global keys meant one user could exhaust the quota for everyone in the same isolate.
5. **Test harness improvements** — `nav` selectors scoped to `nav[aria-label="Main navigation"]` (3 nav landmarks now: main nav, hero top-tasks, mobile bottom tab bar). `axe-core` scans pre-reveal `[data-reveal]` elements before scanning. Skip-link tests skip on touch profiles. Admin-auth tests skip when `BASE_URL=http://localhost:*` (different `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.dev.vars`).
6. **Cleanup** — deleted unused `components/ui/card.tsx` + `components/ui/button.tsx` (zero imports). Badge stays.

## What's mocked / missing

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| In-memory rate limit cross-isolate | ACCEPTABLE FOR SCALE | Per-IP keys mean one user can't block another inside an isolate. Cross-isolate spillover is theoretically possible under heavy attack — for stricter enforcement, migrate to D1 atomic counters or Durable Objects. Not pressing at current traffic. |
| CSRF token integration | DEFERRED | `csrf.ts` defined but not invoked. SameSite=Strict cookies + same-origin server-fn endpoints already prevent CSRF in modern browsers. Reinstate as defense-in-depth if/when adding cross-origin embeds. |
| CF Web Analytics | NOT CONFIGURED | Beacon script ready in `__root.tsx`; needs a token from CF dashboard. |
| Service worker / offline | NOT SHIPPED | Manifest is complete; SW is a future PR for the emergency module. |
| Spanish translation review | NEEDED | `es.json` is machine-translated. Schedule native review before claiming bilingual support in marketing. |

---

## What's broken

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| React minified error #418 (hydration warning, no visible effect) | LOW | Framework-level, likely from TanStack Start `<Scripts />` + React 19 script auto-hoisting. Multiple targeted fixes attempted in the May 6 session; this is the residual. |
